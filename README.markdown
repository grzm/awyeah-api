# awyeah-api - aws-api for babashka

Cognitect's [aws-api][] and [babashka][]. Aw yeah.

**Alpha** Only gently tested.

awyeah-api is _another_ Clojure library which provides programmatic
access to AWS services from your Clojure **or babashka** program. Its
_raison d'être_ is to be a drop-in replacement for Cognitect's
brilliant [aws-api][] that will work from source with [babashka][].

awyeah-api should work with `com.cognitect.aws/endpoints` and
`com.cognitect.aws` service packages.

### Acknowledgements (and disclaimer)

This port is based on the great work done by the fine folks at
Cognitect. I am not affiliated with Cognitect and this is not a
Cognitect-distributed library.

## Requirements

Requires babashka 1.0.167 or later (bundled clojure.spec.alpha).

## deps
``` clojure
com.grzm/awyeah-api {:git/url "https://github.com/grzm/awyeah-api"
                     :git/sha "1810bf624da2be58c77813106a1d51e32db11690"
                     :git/tag "v0.8.35"}
```

Up to date with `com.cognitect.aws/api {:mvn/version "0.8.596"}` (tagged 2022-09-16).

## In brief

Add to your `deps.edn` for Clojure or `bb.edn` for babashka:

```clojure
{:deps {com.cognitect.aws/endpoints {:mvn/version "1.1.12.307"}
        com.cognitect.aws/s3 {:mvn/version "822.2.1145.0"}
        com.grzm/awyeah-api {:git/url "https://github.com/grzm/awyeah-api"
                             :git/sha "1810bf624da2be58c77813106a1d51e32db11690"
                             :git/tag "v0.8.35"}}}
```

Then:

```clojure
(require '[com.grzm.awyeah.client.api :as aws])

(def s3 (aws/client {:api :s3}))

(def buckets (-> (aws/invoke s3 {:op :ListBuckets})
                 :Buckets))

(prn buckets)
```

## Differences from aws-api

The awyeah-api client does not auto-refresh AWS credentials. The
aws-api behavior relies on features that aren't present in babashka,
and I haven't figured out an alternative implementation of the
behavior. My use case is short-lived scripts, where JVM start-up time
can dwarf script execution time: credentials don't have much time to
get stale. If I had longer-lived processes, start-up time wouldn't be
an issue and I'd just use the Clojure.

The [com.cognitect/http-client][] used by aws-api automatically
uncompresses S3 objects if they have the appropriate content-type
metadata in S3. I've chosen _not_ to replicate this behavior with the
bundled HTTP client based on `java.net.http` as I think it's a bit of
a misfeature to have enabled by default in a programmatic client
library like this. (That said, that makes it less of a drop-in
replacement, doesn't it? I may revisit this.)

See [Porting Decisions](docs/porting-decisions.markdown) if you're
interested in the nitty gritty or are wondering why I made some
decision or other.

## Development

Get thee to a repl!

```sh
bb --classpath $(clojure -Spath -A:bb:dev:test) nrepl-server 1138
```

## Testing

Run the tests against a [LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud) Docker
container.

```sh
bin/dc up
bin/test
bin/dc down
```

## Thanks

Much thanks to [Michiel Borkent](https://michielborkent.nl) for
babashka and providing support and guidance in getting the pieces in
place (java.net.http and various other Java classes) to make this library possible.
